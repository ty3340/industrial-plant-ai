## Maintenance Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **MIXER-01:** Monitor seal performance closely for next 48 hours
2. **REACTOR-01:** Schedule vibration analysis if levels exceed 5.0 mm/s

### Planning Considerations

- **Product A Production:** Safe to proceed if vibration remains <5.0 mm/s
- **Extended Run Capability:** Maximum 72 hours continuous operation recommended
- **Risk Assessment:** LOW-MEDIUM risk for 48-hour production campaign
