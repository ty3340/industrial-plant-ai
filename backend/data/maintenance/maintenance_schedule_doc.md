## Maintenance Rules and Constraints

### Production Scheduling Requirements

1. **Minimum Notice Period:** 72 hours for all production planning
2. **Buffer Time:** 2 hours required after maintenance before production can resume
3. **Validation Runs:** Product A requires 1 validation batch after reactor maintenance
4. **Concurrent Maintenance:** Mixer and Reactor cannot be maintained simultaneously

### Override Conditions

Maintenance can only be postponed if ALL conditions are met:

- Equipment health score > 85% _(TOGGLE: Current score = 87%, change to 75% for NO-GO)_
- No critical alarms in last 7 days
- Written approval from Maintenance Manager
- Maximum postponement: 14 days

## Equipment Health Thresholds

| Equipment  | Current Health Score | Minimum for Operation | Critical Threshold |
| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| MIXER-01   | 91%                  | 70%                   | 60%                |
| REACTOR-01 | 87%                  | 75%                   | 65%                | _(TOGGLE: Change to 73% for NO-GO)_ |
| FILLER-01  | 94%                  | 70%                   | 60%                |

## Special Considerations for Product Types

### Product A

- Cannot be produced within 24 hours after reactor maintenance
- Requires stable temperature control (±0.5°C)
- Mixer speed variance must be <2% (check calibration date)

### Product B

- Can be produced immediately after maintenance
- Less sensitive to equipment variations
- Standard operating parameters apply

### Product C

- Requires specialized cleaning before and after (additional 4 hours)
- Cannot be scheduled within 48 hours of maintenance activities
